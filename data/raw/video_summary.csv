NINTENDO HAS DONE IT AGAIN! The Switch 2's proprietary USB-C dock issue - the most recent example of Nintendo's anti-consumer practices and ""greedy"" behavior. We demonstrate the proprietary handshake protocol using a USB PD sniffer, explaining why third-party USB-C accessories and docks fail. The video explores the impact on consumer choice, innovation, and the tech industry, comparing it to the evolution of universal mobile phone chargers. We discuss the ""slippery slope"" of proprietary lock-ins, Nintendo's refusal to allow local save file backups, and the exorbitant cost of official docks.

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

I've been a FAANG data scientist for over a year now. While that's not a lot of time, I've had the amazing opportunity to work with super star data scientists, be mentored by them, and even start mentoring more junior data scientists! I've learned a lot about what it actually means to be a data scientist. In this video, I talk about why you should not be a data scientist.

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

========================
Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

yAwG8DoTmjI,"How to self study using MOOCS (Udemy, Coursera, and other online courses) | self study online","Hi friends! In this video, I go in depth on how to self study online using online courses and how to not give up like a third of the way in. If you have bought online courses and just never actuallly finished them, you are not alone. An average of only 10% of people actually finish an online course. And I was the 90% too before I developed and went through the process that I talk about in this video.

Be warned, this is a thorough discussion that isn't just tips and tricks - it's going to involve some introspection from you as well. I promise it's worth it though.

vx-x-yXXE9I,The data science resume that got me my FAANG (MANGA?) job (entry level data scientist),"In this video, I go through the resume that got me into FAANG as a data scientist. The resume is the key to getting that interview, which is definitely the hardest part of the entire application process for a data scientist. Our role is super popular but actual positions few and far between. That's why I spent A LOT of time on this resume to get my foot in the door. We're going to go through this line by line and item by item as I go into the details and roast it hard. Sit back and enjoy! :)

_77TxNGR21A,Interview with a quant trader,"This is an extremely lucrative but pretty mysterious job that I know many people are interested in learning more about. In this video, I interview Worthan Kwan, a quant trader at a hedge fund to learn about his day to day, how much money people are really making, what the requirements are to become a quant trader, and much more! I also made a post a few weeks back crowdsourcing questions and I'm pretty proud to say that we got through almost all of them in this video :D

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

By the end of the 11 days, I felt super confident and prepared. I went on to pass my FANG data science interviews and got the job! 

My motto: Minimize effort and maximize outcome!!

Btw apologies about audio quality from about 2  - 3.5 min mark. Something weird happened to my mic :(

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

invk7t5YgcU,"How I design effective study plans for ANY SUBJECT (and stick with them) | trading, coding etc.","Hi friends! Self study is hard! It's hard to design an effective and efficient self study plan and I argue even harder to actually stick with it. It's common to fall into the trap of buying other people's study plans and then giving up. Or falling into tutorial hell and giving up. Or feel frustrated because you feel like you're running around in circles and not seeing progress and giving up. Basically, it's really really easy to give up. So in this video, I'm going to share with you guys 8 crucial ingredients that I incorporate into my study plans. The first 5 is for designing the study plan and the last 3 are to make sure that I actually stick with it. 

There you have it: how I design effective study plans and stick with them!

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

r-uOLxNrNk8,"Data Analysis with Python - Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)","Learn Data Analysis with Python in this comprehensive tutorial for beginners, with exercises included!
NOTE: Check description for updated Notebook links.

Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In this tutorial you'll learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.

hDKCxebp88A,Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn ‚Äì Full Course,"This course is a practical and hands-on introduction to Machine Learning with Python and Scikit-Learn for beginners with basic knowledge of Python and statistics.

It is designed and taught by Aakash N S, CEO and co-founder of Jovian. Check out their YouTube channel here: https://youtube.com/@jovianhq

We'll start with the basics of machine learning by exploring models like linear & logistic regression and then move on to tree-based models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosting machines. We'll also discuss best practices for approaching and managing machine learning projects and build a state-of-the-art machine learning model for a real-world dataset from scratch. We'll also look at unsupervised learning & recommendations briefly and walk through the process of deploying a machine-learning model to the cloud using the Flask web framework.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to confidently build, train, and deploy machine learning models in the real world. To get the most out of this course, follow along & type out all the code yourself, and apply the techniques covered here to other real-world datasets & competitions that you can find on platforms like Kaggle.

‚û°Ô∏è More Advise from Harry:
Many people say that in the AI era , programming is dead. But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!
AI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.

‚û°Ô∏è More Advise from Harry:
Many people say that in the AI era , programming is dead. But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!
AI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.

SO8lBVWF2Y8,Why Signals Are Better Than React Hooks,"Hooks in React are tricky to use correctly and even harder to use in a performant way. This has left many applications with poor code quality and bad performance, but that doesn‚Äôt have to be the case anymore.

I love Tailwind. It is one of (if not) my favorite ways to style applications. I do have one issue with Tailwind, though, and that is how people go about learning it. In order to truly learn and master Tailwind you do not need to actually learn much at all about Tailwind. Instead you need to master CSS since Tailwind is really just CSS with some slightly different names and a few extra features.

tz0fDABt67g,Every Beginner React Developer Makes This Mistake With State,"FREE React Hooks Course: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/react-hooks-simplified

By far one of the biggest beginner React mistakes I see is developers storing derived state. This is a huge problem that is incredibly hard to detect unless you know what you are looking for. In this video I will show you what the signs are of derived state so you can make sure you never store derived state.

U7eGCZAfDyU,Why I Get Up At 5AM And Why You Should Too,"If you asked me what the single most important thing I did to grow my YouTube channel was I would hands down say getting up at 5AM was it. By getting up so early I was able to get a head start on my day which meant I could get tons of work done before most other people even think of getting up. On top of that it left me with more open afternoons to enjoy the nice weather and sunshine of the day. The reason this is so effective is because our will power is a resource which starts to run out after working a full day. This means that by the time we reach the end of the work day we have very little or no willpower to do the things we want. This is why I get up at 5AM so I can do all the productive activities I enjoy such as making these videos and going to the gym. If you haven't tried getting up earlier I highly recommend it.


üß† Concepts Covered:

- Why getting up early leads to productivity
- Why I get up early
- How to get started waking up early

NINTENDO HAS DONE IT AGAIN! The Switch 2's proprietary USB-C dock issue - the most recent example of Nintendo's anti-consumer practices and ""greedy"" behavior. We demonstrate the proprietary handshake protocol using a USB PD sniffer, explaining why third-party USB-C accessories and docks fail. The video explores the impact on consumer choice, innovation, and the tech industry, comparing it to the evolution of universal mobile phone chargers. We discuss the ""slippery slope"" of proprietary lock-ins, Nintendo's refusal to allow local save file backups, and the exorbitant cost of official docks.

‚û°Ô∏è More Advise from Harry:
Many people say that in the AI era , programming is dead. But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!
AI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.

‚û°Ô∏è More Advise from Harry:
Many people say that in the AI era , programming is dead. But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!
AI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.
