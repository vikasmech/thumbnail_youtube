Check out their YouTube channel here: https://youtube.com/@jovianhq\n\nWe'll start with the basics of machine learning by exploring models like linear & logistic regression and then move on to tree-based models like decision trees, random forests, and gradient-boosting machines. We'll also discuss best practices for approaching and managing machine learning projects and build a state-of-the-art machine learning model for a real-world dataset from scratch. We'll also look at unsupervised learning & recommendations briefly and walk through the process of deploying a machine-learning model to the cloud using the Flask web framework.\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll be able to confidently build, train, and deploy machine learning models in the real world. To get the most out of this course, follow along & type out all the code yourself, and apply the techniques covered here to other real-world datasets & competitions that you can find on platforms like Kaggle.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Try interactive Python courses we love, right in your browser: https://scrimba.com/freeCodeCamp-Python (Made possible by a grant from our friends at Scrimba)\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Topics & Notebooks \u2b50\ufe0f\n\n\u2328\ufe0f (00:00:00) Introduction \n\u2328\ufe0f (00:00:25) Lesson 1 - Linear Regression and Gradient Descent\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-sklearn-linear-regression\n\u2328\ufe0f (02:17:30) Lesson 2 - Logistic Regression for Classification\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-sklearn-logistic-regression\n\u2328\ufe0f (04:53:26) Lesson 3 - Decision Trees and Random Forests\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.ai/aakashns/sklearn-decision-trees-random-forests\n\u2328\ufe0f (07:25:29) Lesson 4 - How to Approach Machine Learning Projects\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.com/aakashns/how-to-approach-ml-problems\n\u2328\ufe0f (10:06:13) Lesson 5 - Gradient Boosting Machines with XGBoost\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.ai/aakashns/python-gradient-boosting-machines\n\u2328\ufe0f (12:20:57) Lesson 6 - Unsupervised Learning using Scikit-Learn\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.ai/aakashns/sklearn-unsupervised-learning , https://jovian.ai/aakashns/movielens-fastai\n\u2328\ufe0f (13:53:18) Lesson 7 - Machine Learning Project from Scratch\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.com/aakashns/nyc-taxi-fare-prediction-filled , https://jovian.com/aakashns/nyc-taxi-fare-prediction-blank\n\u2328\ufe0f (16:45:47) Lesson 8 - Deploying a Machine Learning Project with Flask\n \ud83d\udd17 https://jovian.com/biraj/deploying-a-machine-learning-model\n\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e davthecoder\n\ud83d\udc7e jedi-or-sith\n\ud83d\udc7e \u5357\u5bae\u5343\u5f71\n\ud83d\udc7e Agust\u00edn Kussrow\n\ud83d\udc7e Nattira Maneerat\n\ud83d\udc7e Heather Wcislo\n\ud83d\udc7e Serhiy Kalinets\n\ud83d\udc7e Justin Hual\n\ud83d\udc7e Otis Morgan \n\ud83d\udc7e Oscar Rahnama\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news",

But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!\nAI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Hosting\nIf you want to host a website on a VPS and get $200 in credits, use my DigitalOcean Link\nGet Free 200$ DigitalOcean Credits here: https://m.do.co/c/2f2aa100b7ee\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Follow Me On Social Media\n\u25ba Website (Created Using Next.js): https://www.codewithharry.com\n\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeWithHarry\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/CodeWithHarry/ \n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeWithHarry\n\u25ba English channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7btqG2Ww0_2LwuQxpvo2HQ\nComment \"#HarryBhai\" if you read this \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",

    "description": "If you asked me what the single most important thing I did to grow my YouTube channel was I would hands down say getting up at 5AM was it. By getting up so early I was able to get a head start on my day which meant I could get tons of work done before most other people even think of getting up. On top of that it left me with more open afternoons to enjoy the nice weather and sunshine of the day. The reason this is so effective is because our will power is a resource which starts to run out after working a full day. This means that by the time we reach the end of the work day we have very little or no willpower to do the things we want. This is why I get up at 5AM so I can do all the productive activities I enjoy such as making these videos and going to the gym. If you haven't tried getting up earlier I highly recommend it.\n\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Concepts Covered:\n\n- Why getting up early leads to productivity\n- Why I get up early\n- How to get started waking up early\n\n\n\ud83c\udf0e Find Me Here:\n\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#5AM #WDS #WakeUpEarly",

But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!\nAI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Hosting\nIf you want to host a website on a VPS and get $200 in credits, use my DigitalOcean Link\nGet Free 200$ DigitalOcean Credits here: https://m.do.co/c/2f2aa100b7ee\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Follow Me On Social Media\n\u25ba Website (Created Using Next.js): https://www.codewithharry.com\n\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeWithHarry\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/CodeWithHarry/ \n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeWithHarry\n\u25ba English channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7btqG2Ww0_2LwuQxpvo2HQ\nComment \"#HarryBhai\" if you read this \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",

But I don't think so. AI is a tool that can help you in your programming journey. But dont overuse it in the  beginning. Try to learn basics first!\nAI can help you write better code, debug your code, and even help you learn new programming languages. So don't be afraid of AI, embrace it and use it to your advantage. Talk to ChatGPT daily and you will realize how quickly you can learn new things and build software. What others think is a disadvantage will become your advantage.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Hosting\nIf you want to host a website on a VPS and get $200 in credits, use my DigitalOcean Link\nGet Free 200$ DigitalOcean Credits here: https://m.do.co/c/2f2aa100b7ee\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Follow Me On Social Media\n\u25ba Website (Created Using Next.js): https://www.codewithharry.com\n\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CodeWithHarry\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/CodeWithHarry/ \n\u25ba Twitter: https://twitter.com/CodeWithHarry\n\u25ba English channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7btqG2Ww0_2LwuQxpvo2HQ\nComment \"#HarryBhai\" if you read this \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09",
